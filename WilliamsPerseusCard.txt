        arms and the man i sing who first made way predestined exile from the trojan shore to italy the blest lavinian strand smitten of storms he was on land and sea by violence of heaven to satisfy stern junos sleepless wrath and much in war he suffered seeking at the last to found  the city and bring oer his fathers gods to safe abode in latium whence arose the latin race old albas reverend lords and from her hills widewalled imperial rome 
		o muse the causes tell what sacrilege or vengeful sorrow moved the heavenly queen to thrust on dangers dark and endless toil a man whose largest honor in mens eyes was serving heaven can gods such anger feel 
		in ages gone an ancient city stood carthage a tyrian seat which from afar made front on italy and on the mouths of tibers stream its wealth and revenues were vast and ruthless was its quest of war t is said that juno of all lands she loved most cherished thisnot samos self so dear here were her arms her chariot even then a throne of power oer nations near and far if fate opposed not t was her darling hope to stablish here but anxiously she heard that of the trojan blood there was a breed then rising which upon the destined day should utterly oerwhelm her tyrian towers a people of wide sway and conquest proud should compass libyas doomsuch was the web the fatal sisters spun such was the fear of saturns daughter who remembered well what long and unavailing strife she waged for her loved greeks at troy nor did she fail to meditate th occasions of her rage and cherish deep within her bosom proud its griefs and wrongs the choice by persnameparispersname made her scorned and slighted beauty a whole race rebellious to her godhead and joves smile that beamed on eagleravished ganymede with all these thoughts infuriate her power pursued with tempests oer the boundless main the trojans though by grecian victor spared and fierce achilles so she thrust them far from latium and they drifted heavenimpelled year after year oer many an unknown sea o labor vast to found the roman line 
		below th horizon the sicilian isle just sank from view as for the open sea with heart of hope they sailed and every ship clove with its brazen beak the salt white waves but juno of her everlasting wound knew no surcease but from her heart of pain thus darkly mused must i defeated fail of what i will nor turn the teucrian king from italy away can fate oppose had pallas power to lay waste in flame the argive fleet and sink its mariners revenging but the sacrilege obscene by ajax wrought oileus desperate son she from the clouds herself joves lightning threw scattered the ships and ploughed the sea with storms her foe from his pierced breast outbreathing fire in whirlwind on a deadly rock she flung but i who move among the gods a queen joves sister and his spouse with one weak tribe make war so long who now on juno calls what suppliant gifts henceforth her altars crown 
		so in her fevered heart complaining still unto the stormcloud land the goddess came a region with wild whirlwinds in its womb aeolia named where royal aeolus in a highvaulted cavern keeps control oer warring winds and loud concourse of storms there closely pent in chains and bastions strong they scornful make the vacant mountain roar chafing against their bonds but from a throne of lofty crag their king with sceptred hand allays their fury and their rage confines did he not so our ocean earth and sky were whirled before them through the vast inane but overruling jove of this in fear hid them in dungeon dark then oer them piled huge mountains and ordained a lawful king to hold them in firm sway or know what time with joves consent to loose them oer the world to him proud juno thus made lowly plea 
		thou in whose hands the father of all gods and sovereign of mankind confides the power to calm the waters or with winds upturn great aeolus a race with me at war now sails the tuscan main towards italy bringing their ilium and its vanquished powers uprouse thy gales strike that proud navy down hurl far and wide and strew the waves with dead twice seven nymphs are mine of rarest mould of whom deiopea the most fair i give thee in true wedlock for thine own to mate thy noble worth she at thy side shall pass long happy years and fruitful bring her beauteous offspring unto thee their sire 
		then aeolus t is thy sole task o queen to weigh thy wish and will my fealty thy high behest obeys this humble throne is of thy gift thy smiles for me obtain authority from jove thy grace concedes my station at your bright olympian board and gives me lordship of the darkening storm 
		replying thus he smote with spear reversed the hollow mountains wall then rush the winds through that wide breach in long embattled line and sweep tumultuous from land to land with brooding pinions oer the waters spread east wind and south and boisterous afric gale upturn the sea vast billows shoreward roll the shout of mariners the creak of cordage follow the shock lowhanging clouds conceal from trojan eyes all sight of heaven and day night oer the ocean broods from sky to sky the thunders roll the ceaseless lightnings glare and all things mean swift death for mortal man straightway aeneas shuddering with amaze groaned loud upraised both holy hands to heaven and thus did plead o thrice and four times blest ye whom your sires and whom the walls of troy looked on in your last hour o bravest son greece ever bore tydides o that i had fallen on ilian fields and given this life struck down by thy strong hand where by the spear of great achilles fiery hector fell and huge sarpedon where the simois in furious flood engulfed and whirled away so many helms and shields and heroes slain 
		while thus he cried to heaven a shrieking blast smote full upon the sail up surged the waves to strike the very stars in fragments flew the shattered oars the helpless vessel veered and gave her broadside to the roaring flood where watery mountains rose and burst and fell now high in air she hangs then yawning gulfs lay bare the shoals and sands oer which she drives three ships a whirling south wind snatched and flung on hidden rocksaltars of sacrifice italians call them which lie far from shore a vast ridge in the sea three ships beside an east wind blowing landward from the deep drove on the shallowspitiable sight and girdled them in walls of drifting sand that ship which with his friend orontes bore the lycian mariners a great plunging wave struck straight astern before aeneas eyes forward the steersman rolled and oer the side fell headlong while three times the circling flood spun the light bark through swift engulfing seas look how the lonely swimmers breast the wave and on the waste of waters wide are seen weapons of war spars planks and treasures rare once iliums boast all mingled with the storm now oer achates and ilioneus now oer the ship of abas or aletes bursts the tempestuous shock their loosened seams yawn wide and yield the angry wave its will 
		meanwhile how all his smitten ocean moaned and how the tempests turbulent assault had vexed the stillness of his deepest cave great neptune knew and with indignant mien uplifted oer the sea his sovereign brow he saw the teucrian navy scattered far along the waters and aeneas men oerwhelmed in mingling shock of wave and sky saturnian junos vengeful stratagem her brothers royal glance failed not to see and loud to eastward and to westward calling he voiced this word
		what pride of birth or power is yours ye winds that reckless of my will audacious thus ye ride through earth and heaven and stir these mountain waves such rebels i nay first i calm this tumult but yourselves by heavier chastisement shall expiate hereafter your bold trespass haste away and bear your king this word not unto him dominion oer the seas and trident dread but unto me fate gives let him possess wild mountain crags thy favored haunt and home o eurus in his barbarous mansion there let aeolus look proud and play the king in yon closebounded prisonhouse of storms 
		he spoke and swiftlier than his word subdued the swelling of the floods dispersed afar th assembled clouds and brought back light to heaven cymothoe then and triton with huge toil thrust down the vessels from the sharpedged reef while with the trident the great gods own hand assists the task then from the sandstrewn shore outebbing far he calms the whole wide sea and glides lightwheeled along the crested foam as when with not unwonted tumult roars in some vast city a rebellious mob and baseborn passions in its bosom burn till rocks and blazing torches fill the air rage never lacks for armsif haply then some wise man comes whose reverend looks attest a life to duty given swift silence falls all ears are turned attentive and he sways with clear and soothing speech the peoples will so ceased the seas uproar when its grave sire looked oer th expanse and riding on in light flung free rein to his winged obedient car 
		aeneas waveworn crew now landward made and took the nearest passage whither lay the coast of libya a haven there walled in by bold sides of a rocky isle offers a spacious and secure retreat where every billow from the distant main breaks and in many a rippling curve retires huge crags and two confronted promontories frown heavenhigh beneath whose brows outspread the silent sheltered waters on the heights the bright and glimmering foliage seems to show a woodland amphitheatre and yet higher rises a straightstemmed grove of dense dark shade fronting on these a grotto may be seen oerhung by steep cliffs from its inmost wall clear springs gush out and shelving seats it has of unhewn stone a place the woodnymphs love in such a port a weary ship rides free of weight of firmfluked anchor or strong chain 
		hither aeneas of his scattered fleet saving but seven into harbor sailed with passionate longing for the touch of land forth leap the trojans to the welcome shore and fling their dripping limbs along the ground then good achates smote a flinty stone secured a flashing spark heaped on light leaves and with dry branches nursed the mounting flame then ceres gift from the corrupting sea they bring away and wearied utterly ply ceres cunning on the rescued corn and parch in flames and mill twixt two smooth stones aeneas meanwhile climbed the cliffs and searched the wide seaprospect haply antheus there stormbuffeted might sail within his ken with biremes and his phrygian mariners or capys or caicus armorclad upon a towering deck no ship is seen but while he looks three stags along the shore come straying by and close behind them comes the whole herd browsing through the lowland vale in one long line aeneas stopped and seized his bow and swiftwinged arrows which his friend trusty achates close beside him bore his first shafts brought to earth the lordly heads of the highantlered chiefs his next assailed the general herd and drove them one and all in panic through the leafy wood nor ceased the victory of his bow till on the ground lay seven huge forms one gift for every ship then back to shore he sped and to his friends distributed the spoil with that rare wine which good acestes while in sicily had stored in jars and princelike sent away with his ioved guestthis too aeneas gave and with these words their mournful mood consoled 
		companions mine we have not failed to feel calamity till now o ye have borne far heavier sorrow jove will make an end also of this ye sailed a course hard by infuriate scyllas howling cliffs and caves ye knew the cyclops crags lift up your hearts no more complaint and fear it well may be some happier hour will find this memory fair through chance and change and hazard without end our goal is latium where our destinies beckon to blest abodes and have ordained that troy shall rise newborn have patience all and bide expectantly that golden day 
		such was his word but vexed with grief and care feigned hopes upon his forehead firm he wore and locked within his heart a heros pain now round the welcome trophies of his chase they gather for a feast some flay the ribs and bare the flesh below some slice with knives and on keen prongs the quivering strips impale place cauldrons on the shore and fan the fires then stretched at ease on couch of simple green they rally their lost powers and feast them well on seasoned wine and succulent haunch of game but hunger banished and the banquet done in long discourse of their lost mates they tell twixt hopes and fears divided for who knows whether the lost ones live or strive with death or heed no more whatever voice may call chiefly aeneas now bewails his friends orontes brave and fallen amycus or mourns with grief untold the untimely doom of bold young gyas and cloanthus bold 
		after these things were past exalted jove from his ethereal sky surveying clear the seas all winged with sails lands widely spread and nations populous from shore to shore paused on the peak of heaven and fixed his gaze on libya but while he anxious mused near him her radiant eyes all dim with tears nor smiling any more venus approached and thus complained o thou who dost control things human and divine by changeless laws enthroned in awful thunder what huge wrong could my aeneas and his trojans few achieve against thy power for they have borne unnumbered deaths and failing italy the gates of all the world against them close hast thou not given us thy covenant that hence the romans when the rolling years have come full cycle shall arise to power from troys regenerate seed and rule supreme the unresisted lords of land and sea o sire what swerves thy will how oft have i in troys most lamentable wreck and woe consoled my heart with this and balanced oft our destined good against our destined ill but the same stormful fortune still pursues my band of heroes on their perilous way when shall these labors cease o glorious king antenor though th achaeans pressed him sore found his way forth and entered unassailed illyrias haven and the guarded land of the liburni straight up stream he sailed where like a swollen sea timavus pours a ninefold flood from roaring mountain gorge and whelms with voiceful wave the fields below he built patavium there and fixed abodes for troys farexiled sons he gave a name to a new land and race the trojan arms were hung on temple walls and to this day lying in perfect peace the hero sleeps but we of thine own seed to whom thou dost a station in the arch of heaven assign behold our navy vilely wrecked because a single god is angry we endure this treachery and violence whereby wide seas divide us from th hesperian shore is this what piety receives or thus doth heavens decree restore our fallen thrones 
		smiling reply the sire of gods and men with such a look as clears the skies of storm chastely his daughter kissed and thus spake on let cytherea cast her fears away irrevocably blest the fortunes be of thee and thine nor shalt thou fail to see that city and the proud predestined wall encompassing lavinium thyself shall starward to the heights of heaven bear aeneas the greathearted nothing swerves my will once uttered since such carking cares consume thee i this hour speak freely forth and leaf by leaf the book of fate unfold thy son in italy shall wage vast war and quell its nations wild his citywall and sacred laws shall be a mighty bond about his gathered people summers three shall latium call him king and three times pass the winter oer rutulias vanquished hills his heir ascanius now iulus called ilus it was while iliums kingdom stood full thirty months shall reign then move the throne from the lavinian citadel and build for alba longa its wellbastioned wall

		these words he gave and summoned maias son the herald mercury who earthward flying should bid the tyrian realms and newbuilt towers welcome the trojan waifs lest dido blind to fates decree should thrust them from the land he takes his flight with rhythmic stroke of wing across th abyss of air and soon draws near unto the libyan mainland he fulfils his heavenly task the punic hearts of stone grow soft beneath the effluence divine and most of all the queen with heart at ease awaits benignantly her guests from troy 
		but good aeneas pondering all night long his many cares when first the cheerful dawn upon him broke resolved to take survey of this strange country whither wind and wave had driven himfor desert land it seemed to learn what tribes of man or beast possess a place so wild and careful tidings bring back to his friends his fleet of ships the while where dense dark groves oerarch a hollowed crag he left encircled in farbranching shade then with no followers save his trusty friend achates he went forth upon his way two broadtipped javelins poising in his hand deep to the midmost wood he went and there his mother in his path uprose she seemed in garb and countenance a maid and bore like spartan maids a weapon in such guise harpalyce the thracian urges on her panting coursers and in wild career outstrips impetuous hebrus as it flows over her lovely shoulders was a bow slender and light as fits a huntress fair her golden tresses without wimple moved in every wind and girded in a knot her undulant vesture bared her marble knees she hailed them thus ho sirs i pray you tell if haply ye have noted as ye came one of my sisters in this wood astray she bore a quiver and a lynxs hide her spotted mantle was perchance she roused some foaming boar and chased with loud halloo 
		so venus spoke and venus son replied no voice or vision of thy sister fair has crossed my path thou maid without a name thy beauty seems not of terrestrial mould nor is thy music mortal tell me goddess art thou bright phoebus sister or some nymph the daughter of a god whateer thou art thy favor we implore and potent aid in our vast toil instruct us of what skies or what worlds end our stormswept lives have found strange are these lands and people where we rove compelled by wind and wave lo this right hand shall many a victim on thine altar slay

		she ceased and turned away a roseate beam from her bright shoulder glowed th ambrosial hair breathed more than mortal sweetness while her robes fell rippling to her feet each step revealed the veritable goddess now he knew that vision was his mother and his words pursued the fading phantom as it fled why is thy son deluded oer and oer with mocking dreamsanother cruel god hast thou no handclasp true nor interchange of words unfeigned betwixt this heart and thine such word of blame he spoke and took his way toward the citys rampart venus then oerveiled them as they moved in darkened air a liquid mantle of thick cloud divine that viewless they might pass nor would any obstruct delay or question why they came to paphos then she soared her ioved abode where stands her temple at whose hundred shrines garlands of myrtle and fresh roses breathe and clouds of orient sweetness waft away 
		meanwhile the wanderers swiftly journey on along the clearmarked road and soon they climb the brow of a high hill which close in view oertowers the citys crown the vast exploit where lately rose but afric cabins rude aeneas wondered at the smooth wide ways the bastioned gates the uproar of the throng the tyrians toil unwearied some upraise a wall or citadel from far below lifting the ponderous stone or with due care choose where to build and close the space around with sacred furrow in their gatheringplace the people for just governors just laws and for their reverend senate shout acclaim some clear the harbor mouth some deeply lay the base of a great theatre and carve out proud columns from the mountain to adorn their rising stage with lofty ornament so busy bees above a field of flowers in early summer amid sunbeams toil leading abroad their nations youthful brood or with the flowing honey storing close the pliant cells until they quite run oer with nectared sweet while from the entering swarm they take their little loads or lined for war rout the dull drones and chase them from the hive brisk is the task and all the honeyed air breathes odors of wild thyme how blest of heaven these men that see their promised ramparts rise aeneas sighed and swift his glances moved from tower to tower then on his way he fared veiled in the wondercloud whence all unseen of human eyeso strange the tale and true he threaded the thronged streets unmarked unknown

		but lo just scaped of pyrrhus murderous hand polites one of priams sons fled fast along the corridors through thronging foes and a thick rain of spears wildly he gazed across the desolate halls wounded to death fierce pyrrhus followed after pressing hard with mortal stroke and now his hand and spear were close upon when the lost youth leaped forth into his fathers sight and prostrate there lay dying while his lifeblood ebbed away then priam though on all sides death was nigh quit not the strife nor from loud wrath refrained thy crime and impious outrage may the gods if heaven to mortals render debt and due justly reward and worthy honors pay my own sons murder thou hast made me see blood and pollution impiously throwing upon a fathers head not such was he not such achilles thy pretended sire when priam was his foe with flush of shame he nobly listened to a suppliants plea in honor made he rendered to the tomb my hectors body pale and me did send back to my throne a king with this proud word the aged warrior hurled with nerveless arm his ineffectual spear which hoarsely rang rebounding on the brazen shield and hung piercing the midmost boss but all in vain then pyrrhus take these tidings and convey message to my father peleus son tell him my naughty deeds be sure and say how neoptolemus hath shamed his sires now die with this he trailed before the shrines the trembling king whose feet slipped in the stream of his sons blood then pyrrhus left hand clutched the tresses old and gray a glittering sword his right hand lifted high and buried it far as the hilt in that defenceless heart so priams story ceased such final doom fell on him while his dying eyes surveyed troy burning and her altars overthrown though once of many an orient land and tribe the boasted lord in huge dismemberment his severed trunk lies tombless on the shore the head from shoulder torn the corpse unknown 
		then first wild horror on my spirit fell and dazed me utterly a vision rose of my own cherished father as i saw the king his aged peer sore wounded iying in mortal agony a vision too of lost creusa at my ravaged hearth and young iulus peril then my eyes looked round me seeking aid but all were fled warwearied and undone some earthward leaped from battlement or tower some in despair yielded their suffering bodies to the flame 
		i stood there sole surviving when behold to vestas altar clinging in dumb fear hiding and crouching in the hallowed shade tyndarus daughter t was the burning town lighted full well my roving steps and eyes in fear was she both of some trojans rage for troy oerthrown and of some greek revenge or her wronged husbands iong indignant ire so hid she at that shrine her hateful brow being of greece and troy full well she knew the common curse then in my bosom rose a blaze of wrath methought i should avenge my dying country and with horrid deed pay crime for crime shall she return unscathed to sparta to mycenaes golden pride and have a royal triumph shall her eyes her sire and sons her hearth and husband see while phrygian captives follow in her train is priam murdered have the flames swept oer my native troy and cloth our dardan strand sweat oer and oer with sanguinary dew o not thus unavenged for though there be no glory if i smite a womans crime nor conquerors fame for such a victory won yet if i blot this monster out and wring full punishment from guilt the time to come will praise me and sweet pleasure it will be to glut my soul with vengeance and appease the ashes of my kindred
		so i raved and to such frenzied purpose gave my soul then with clear vision never had i seen her presence so unclouded i beheld in golden beams that pierced the midnight gloom my gracious mother visibly divine and with that mien of majesty she wears when seen in heaven she stayed me with her hand and from her lips of rose this counsel gave o son what sorrow stirs thy boundless rage what madness this or whither vanisheth thy love of me wilt thou not seek to know where bides anchises thy abandoned sire now weak with age or if creusa lives and young ascanius who are ringed about with ranks of grecian foes and long ere this save that my love can shield them and defend had fallen on flame or fed some hungry sword not helens hated beauty works thee woe nor paris oftaccused the cruelty of gods of gods unaided overwhelms thy countrys power and from its iofty height casts ilium down behold i take away the barriercloud that dims thy mortal eye with murk and mist oerveiling fear not thou to heed thy mothers word nor let thy heart refuse obedience to her counsel given mid yonder trembling ruins where thou seest stone torn from stone with dust and smoke uprolling t is neptune strikes the wall his trident vast makes her foundation tremble and unseats the city from her throne fierce juno leads resistless onset at the scaean gate and summons from the ships the league of powers wearing her wrathful sword on yonder height behold tritonia in the citadel clothed with the lightning and her gorgonshield unto the greeks great jove himself renews their courage and their power t is he thrusts on the gods themselves against the trojan arms fly o my son the wars wild work give oer i will be always nigh and set thee safe upon thy fathers threshold having said she fled upon the viewless night away 
		then loomed oer troy the apparition vast of her dread foes divine i seemed to see all ilium sink in fire and sacred troy of neptunes building utterly oerthrown so some huge ashtree on the mountains brow when rival woodmen heaving stroke on stroke of twoedged axes haste to cast her down sways ominously her trembling leafy top and drops her smitten head till by her wounds vanquished at last she makes her dying groan and falls in loud wreck from the cliffs uptorn i left the citadel and led by heaven threaded the maze of deadly foes and fires through spears that glanced aside and flames that fell 
		soon came i to my fathers ancient seat our home and heritage but lo my sire whom first of all i sought and first would bear to safe asylum in the distant hills vowed he could never after fallen troy live longer on or bear an exiles woe o you he cried whose blood not yet betrays the cruel taint of time whose powers be still unpropped and undecayed go take your flight if heavenly wrath had willed my life to spare this dwelling had been safe it is too much that i have watched one wreck and for too iong outlived my vanquished country thus o thus compose these limbs for death and say farewell my own hand will procure it or my foe will end me of mere pity and for spoil will strip me bare it is an easy loss to have no grave for many a year gone by accursed of heaven i tarry in this world a useless burden since that fatal hour when jove of gods the sire and men the king his lightnings oer me breathed and blasting fire 
		such fixed resolve he uttered oer and oer and would not yield though with my tears did join my spouse creusa fair ascanius and our whole house imploring the gray sire not with himself to ruin all nor add yet heavier burdens to our crushing doom he still cried no and clung to where he sat and to the same dread purpose i once more back to the fight would speed for death alone i made my wretched prayer what space was left for wisdom now what chance or hope was given didst thou dear father dream that i could fly sundered from thee did such an infamy fall from a fathers lips if heavens decree will of this mighty nation not let live a single soul if thine own purpose be to cast thyself and thy posterity into thy countrys grave behold the door is open to thy death lo pyrrhus comes redhanded from king priam he has slain a son before a fathers eyes and spilt a fathers blood upon his own hearthstone was it for this o heavenly mother mine that thou hast brought me safe through sword and fire that i might see these altars desecrate by their worst foes that i might look upon my sire my wife and sweet ascanius dead at my feet in one anothers blood to arms my men to arms the hour of death now beckons to the vanquished let me go whither the greeks are gathered let me stand where oft revives the flagging stroke of war not all of us die unavenged this day 
		i clasped my swordbelt round me once again fitted my left arm to my shield and turned to fly the house but at the threshold clung creusa to my knees and lifted up iulus to his fathers arms if thou wouldst rush on death she cried o suffer us to share thy perils with thee to the end but if this days work bid thee trust a sword defend thy hearthstone first who else shall guard thy babe iulus or thy reverend sire or me thy wife that waswhat help have i 
		so rang the rooftop with her piteous cries but lo a portent wonderful to see on sudden rose for while his parents grief held the boy close in arm and full in view there seemed upon iulus head to glow a flickering peak of fire the tongue of flame innocuous oer his clustering tresses played and hovered round his brows we horrorstruck grasped at his burning hair and sprinkled him to quench that holy and auspicious fire then sire anchises with exultant eyes looked heavenward and lifted to the stars his voice and outstretched hands almighty jove if aught of prayer may move thee let thy grace now visit us o hear this holy vow and if for service at thine altars done we aught can claim o father lend us aid and ratify the omen thou hast given 
		scarce ceased his aged voice when suddenly  from leftward with a deafening thunderpeal  cleaving the blackness of the vaulted sky a meteorstar in trailing splendor ran  exceeding bright we watched it glide sublime oer tower and town until its radiant beam  in forestmantled ida died away but left a furrow on its track in air a glittering iong line while far and wide the sulphurous fume and exhalation flowed my father strove not now but lifted him in prayer to all the gods in holy awe of that auspicious star and thus exclaimed tarry no moment more behold i come whithersoeer ye lead my steps obey gods of my fathers o preserve our name preserve my son and his this augury is yours and troy on your sole strength relies i yield dear son i journey at thy side he spoke and higher oer the blazing walls leaped the loud fire while ever nearer drew the rolling surges of tumultuous flame haste father on these bending shoulders climb this back is ready and the burden light one peril smites us both whateer befall one rescue both shall find close at my side let young iulus run while not too nigh my wife creusa heeds what way we go ye servants of our house give ear i pray to my command outside the citys gates lies a low mound and long since ruined fane to ceres vowed a cypress ancient shade oerhangs it which our fathers pious care protected year by year by various paths be that our meetingplace but in thy hands bring sire our household gods and sanctifies for me to touch who come this very hour from battle and the fresh blood of the slain were but abomination till what time in living waters i shall make me clean so saying i bowed my neck and shoulders broad oerspread me with a lions tawny skin and lifted up my load close at my side little iulus twined his hand in mine and followed with unequal step his sire my wife at distance came we hastened on creeping through shadows i who once had viewed undaunted every instrument of war and all the gathered greeks in grim array now shook at every gust and heard all sounds with fevered trepidation fearing both for him i bore and him who clasped my hand now near the gates i drew and deemed our flight safely at end when suddenly i heard the sounding tread of many warriors that seemed hardby while through the murky night my father peered and shouted o my son away away for surely all our foes are here upon us and my eyes behold the glance of glittering shields and flash of arms o then some evilworking nameless god clouded my senses quite for while i sped along our pathless way and left behind all paths and regions knowno wretched me creusa on some dark disaster fell she stopped or wandered or sank down undone i never knew what wayand nevermore i looked on her alive yet knew i not my loss nor backward turned a look or thought till by that hallowed hill to ceres vowed we gathered all and she alone came not while husband friends and son made search in vain what god what man did not my grief accuse in frenzied word in all the ruined land what worse woe had i seen entrusting then my sire my son and all the teucrian gods to the deep shadows of a slanting vale where my allies kept guard i tried me back to that doomed town regirt in glittering arms resolved was i all hazards to renew all troy to reexplore and once again offer my life to perils without end 
		the walls and gloomy gates whence forth i came i first revisit and retrace my way searching the night once more on all sides round horror spread wide the very silence breathed a terror on my soul i hastened then back to my fallen home if haply there her feet had strayed but the invading greeks were its possessors though the hungry fire was blown along the rooftree and the flames rolled raging upward on the fitful gale to priams house i haste and climb once more the citadel in junos temple there the chosen guardians of her wasted halls phoenix and dread ulysses watched the spoil here snatched away from many a burning fane troys treasures layrich tables for the gods thick bowls of messy gold and vestures rare confusedly heaped up while round the pile fair youths and trembling virgins stood forlorn yet oft my voice rang dauntless through the gloom from street to street i cried with anguish vain and on creusa piteously calling woke the lamenting echoes oer and oer while on this quest i roamed the city through of reason reft there rose upon my sight o shape of sorrow my creusas ghost hers truly though a loftier port it wore i quailed my hair rose and i gasped for fear but thus she spoke and soothed my grief away why to these frenzied sorrows bend thy soul o husband ever dear the will of heaven hath brought all this to pass fate doth not send creusa the long journeys thou shalt take or hath th olympian king so given decree long is thy banishment thy ship must plough the vast farspreading sea then shalt thou come unto hesperia whose fruitful plains  are watered by the tiber lydian stream  of smooth benignant bow thou shalt obtain  fair fortunes and a throne and royal bride for thy beloved creusa weep no more no myrmidons proud palace waits me now dolopian shall not scorn nor argive dames command a slave of dardans royal stem and wife to venus son on these loved shores the mother of the gods compels my stay farewell farewell o cherish evermore thy son and mine her utterance scarce had ceased when as i strove through tears to make reply she left me and dissolved in empty air thrice would my frustrate arms her form enfold thrice from the clasp of hand that vision fled like wafted winds and like a fleeting dream 
		the night had passed and to my friends once more i made my way much wondering to find a mighty multitude assembled there of friends newcomematrons and menatarms and youth for exile bound a doleful throng from far and near they drew their hearts prepared and their possessions gathered to sail forth to lands unknown wherever oer the wave i bade them follow now above the crest of loftiest ida rose the morningstar  chief in the front of day the greeks held fast the captive gates of troy no help or hope was ours any more then yielding all and lifting once again my aged sire for refuge to the distant hills i fleddiv1  
		 when asias power and priams race and throne though guiltless were cast down by heavens decree when ilium proud had fallen and neptunes troy in smouldering ash lay level with the ground to wandering exile then and regions wild the gods by many an augury and sign compelled us forth we fashioned us a fleet within antanders haven in the shade of phrygian idas peak though knowing not whither our fate would drive or where afford a restingplace at last and my small band of warriors i arrayed as soon as smiled the light of summers prime my reverend sire anchises bade us on the winds of fate to spread all sail through tears i saw recede my native shore the haven and the plains where once was troy an exile on the seas with son and followers and household shrines and troys great guardiangods i took my way 
		there is a faroff land where warriors breed where thracians till the boundless plains and where the crueleyed lycurgus once was king troys old ally it was its deities had brotherhood with ours before our fall thither i fared and on its winding shores set my first walls though partial fate opposed our entrance there in memory of my name i called its people the aeneadae 
		unto diones daughter and all gods who blessed our young emprise due gifts were paid and unto the supreme celestial king i slew a fair white bull beside the sea but haply near my place of sacrifice a mound was seen and on the summit grew a copse of corner and a myrtle tree with spearlike limbs outbranched on every side this i approached and tried to rend away from its deep roots that grove of gloomy green and dress my altars in its leafy boughs but horrible to tell a prodigy smote my astonished eyes for the first tree which from the earth with broken roots i drew dripped black with bloody drops and gave the ground dark stains of gore cold horror shook my frame and every vein within me froze for fear once more i tried from yet another stock the pliant stem to tear and to explore the mystery withinbut yet again the foul bark oozed with clots of blackest gore from my deepshaken soul i made a prayer to all the woodland nymphs and to divine gradivus patron of the thracian plain to bless this sight to lift its curse away but when at a third sheaf of myrtle spears i fell upon my knees and tugged amain against the adverse ground i dread to tell a moaning and a wail from that deep grave burst forth and murmured in my listening ear why wound me great aeneas in my woe o spare the dead nor let thy holy hands do sacrilege and sin i trojanborn was kin of thine this blood is not of trees haste from this murderous shore this land of greed o i am polydorus haste away here was i pierced a crop of iron spears  has grown up oer my breast and multiplied  to all these deadly javelins keen and strong then stood i burdened with dark doubt and fear i quailed my hair rose and my utterance choked 
		for once this polydorus with much gold illfated priam sent by stealth away for nurture with the thracian king what time dardanias war iooked hopeless and her towers were ringed about by unrelenting siege that king when iliums cause was ebbing low and fortune frowned gave oer his plighted faith to agamemnons might and victory he scorned all honor and did murder foul on polydorus seizing lawlessly on all the gold o whither at thy will curst greed of gold may mortal hearts be driven soon as my shuddering ceased i told this tale of prodigies before the peoples chiefs who sat in conclave with my kingly sire and bade them speak their reverend counsel forth all found one voice to leave that land of sin where foul abomination had profaned a strangers right and once more to resign our fleet unto the tempest and the wave but fit and solemn funeral rites were paid to polydorus a high mound we reared of heapedup earth and to his honored shade built a perpetual altar sadly dressed in cypress dark and purple pall of woe our ilian women wailed with loosened hair new milk was sprinkled from a foaming cup and from the shallow bowl fresh blood outpoured upon the sacred ground so in its tomb we laid his ghost to rest and loudly sang with prayer for peace the long the last farewell 
		after these things when first the friendly sea looked safe and fair and oer its tranquil plain lightwhispering breezes bade us launch away my men drew down our galleys to the brine thronging the shore soon out of port we ran and watched the hills and cities fading far there is a sacred island in midseas to fruitful doris and to neptune dear which grateful phoebus wielder of the bow the while it drifted loose from land to land chained firmly where the crags of gyaros and myconos uptower and bade it rest immovable in scorn of wind and wave thither i sped by this my weary ships found undisturbed retreat and haven fair to land we came and saw with reverent eyes apollos citadel king anius his peoples king and priest at phoebus fane came forth to meet us wearing on his brow the fillets and a holy laurel crown unto anchises he gave greeting kind claimed old acquaintance grasped us by the hand and bade us both his roof and welcome share 
		then kneeling at the shrine of timeworn stone thou who at thymbra on the trojan shore hast often blessed my prayer o give to me a hearth and home and to this warworn band defensive towers and offspring multiplied in an abiding city give to troy a second citadel that shall survive achilles wrath and all our argive foe whom shall we follow whither lies our way where wilt thou grant us an abidingplace send forth o king thy voice oracular and on our spirits move 
		scarce had i spoke when sudden trembling through the laurels ran and smote the holy portals far and wide the mighty ridges of the mountain shook and from the opening shrine the tripod moaned prostrate to earth we fall as on our ears this utterance breaks o breed of iron men ye sons of dardanus the selfsame land where bloomed at first your fardescended stem shall to its bounteous bosom draw ye home seek out your ancient mother there at last aeneas race shall reign on every shore and his sons sons and all their house to be so phoebus spoke and mighty joy uprose from all my thronging people who would know where phoebus city lay and whitherward the god ordained the wandering tribes return then spake my father pondering olden days and sacred memories of heroes gone hear chiefs and princes what your hopes shall be the isle of crete abode of lofty jove rests in the middle sea thence ida soars there is the cradle of our race it boasts a hundred cities seats of fruitful power thence our chief sire if duly i recall the olden tale king teucer sprung who first touched on the trojan shore and chose his seat of kingly power there was no ilium then nor towered pergama in lowly vales their dwelling hence the ancient worship given to the protectress of mount cybele mother of gods what time in idas grove the brazen corybantic cymbals clang or sacred silence guards her mystery and lions yoked her royal chariot draw up then and follow the behests divine pour offering to the winds and point your keels unto that realm of minos it is near if jove but bless the third days dawn should see our ships at cretan land so having said he slew the victims for each altars praise a bull to neptune and a bull to thee o beauteous apollo a black lamb unto the clouds and storms but fleece of snow to the mild zephyrs was our offering 
		the tale was told us that idomeneus from his hereditary kindgom driven had left his crete abandoned that no foe now harbored there but all its dwellings lay untenanted of man so forth we sailed out of the port of delos and sped far along the main the maenadhaunted hills of naxos came in view the ridges green of fair donysa with olearos and paros gleaming white and cyclades scattered among the waves as close we ran where thickstrewn islands vex the channelled seas with rival shout the sailors cheerly called on comrades on to crete and to our sires freely behind us blew the friendly winds  and gave smooth passage to that fabled shore the land of the curetes friends of jove there eagerly i labored at the walls of our longprayedfor city and its name was pergamea to my trojan band pleased with such name i gave command to build altar and hearth and raise the lofty tower 
		but scarce the ships were beached along the strand while oer the isle my busy mariners ploughed in new fields and took them wives once more  i giving homes and laws when suddenly a pestilence from some infectious sky seized on mans flesh and horribly exhaled oer trees and crops a fatal year of plague some breathed their last while others weak and worn lived on the dogstar parched the barren fields grass withered and the sickly mouldering corn refused us life my aged father then bade us recross the waves and reimplore apollos mercy at his island shrine if haply of our weariness and woe he might vouchsafe the end or bid us find help for our task or guidance oer the sea 
		t was night and sleep possessed all breathing things when lo the sacred effigies divine the phrygian gods which through the flames i bore from fallen troy seemed in a vision clear to stand before me where i slumbering lay bathed in bright beams which from the moon at full streamed through the latticed wall and thus they spoke to soothe my care away apollos word which in far delos the god meant for thee is uttered here behold he sends ourselves to this thy house before thy prayer is made we from troys ashes have companioned thee in every fight and we the swollen seas guided by thee in thine own ships have crossed our power divine shall set among the stars thy seed to be and to thy city give dominion evermore for mighty men go build its mighty walls seek not to shun the hard long labors of an exiles way change this abode not thine this cretan shore nor here would delian phoebus have thee bide there is a land the roving greeks have named hesperia it is a storied realm made mighty by great wars and fruitful land oenotrians had it and their sons t is said have called it italy a chieftains name to a whole region given that land alone our true abode can be for dardanus was cradled there and old iasius their blood the oldest of our ancient line arise go forth and cheer thy father gray with the glad tidings bid him doubt no more ausonia seek and corythus for jove denies this cretan realm to thine and thee i marvelled at the heavenly presences so vocal and so bright for t was not sleep but face to face i deemed i could discern each countenance august and holy brow each mantled head and from my body ran cold sweat of awe from my low couch i sprang lifting to heaven my suppliant hands and prayer and oer my hearth poured forth libations free after th auspicious offering i told anchises the whole tale in order due he owned our stock twobranched of our great sires the twofold line and that his thought had strayed in new confusion mingling ancient names then spoke o son in iliums doom severe afflicted ever to my ears alone this dark vicissitude cassandra sang i mind me now that her wild tongue foretold such destiny for oft she called aloud hesperia oft italias kingdom called but who had faith that teucers sons should come to far hesperia what mortal ear gave heed to sad cassandras voice divine now phoebus speaks obedient let us be and warned by him our happier iot pursue he spoke with heart of hope we all obeyed again we changed abode and leaving there a feeble few again with spreading sails we coursed in hollow ship the spacious sea 
		when from the deep the shores had faded far and only sky and sea were round our way full in the zenith hung a purple cloud stormladen dark as night and every wave grew black and angry while perpetual gales came rolling oer the main and mountainhigh the wreckful surges rose our ships were hurled wide oer the whirling waters thunderclouds and misty murk of night made end of all the light of heaven save where the rifted storm flashed with the oftreiterate shaft of jove then went we drifting beaten from our course upon a trackless sea not even the eyes of palinurus could tell night from noon or ken our way three days of blinding dark three nights without a star we roved the seas the fourth land seemed to rise far distant hills and rolling smoke we saw down came our sails out flew the oars and with prompt stroke the crews swept the dark waves and tossed the crested foam from such seaperil safe i made the shores of strophadesa name the grecians gave to islands in the broad ionic main  the strophades where dread celaeno bides with other harpies who had quit the halls of stricken phineus and for very fear fled from the routed feast no prodigy more vile than these nor plague more pitiless ere rose by wrath divine from stygian wave birds seem they but with face like womankind foulflowing bellies hands with crooked claws and ghastly lips they have with hunger pale scarce had we made the haven when behold fair herds of cattle roaming a wide plain and horned goats untended feeding free in pastures green surprised our happy eyes with eager blades we ran to take and slay asking of every god and chicfly jove to share the welcome prize we ranged a feast with turfbuilt couches and a banquetboard along the curving strand but in a trice down from the high hills swooping horribly the harpies loudly shrieking flapped their wings snatched at our meats and with infectious touch polluted all infernal was their cry the stench most vile once more in covert far beneath a caverned rock and close concealed with trees and branching shade we raised aloft our tables altars and rekindled fires once more from haunts unknown the clamorous flock from every quarter flew and seized its prey with taloned feet and carrion lip most foul i called my mates to arms and opened war on that accursed brood my band obeyed and hiding in deep grass their swords and shields in ambush lay but presently the foe swept oer the winding shore with loud alarm  then from a sentrycrag misenus blew a signal on his hollow horn my men flew to the combat strange and fain would wound with martial steel those foul birds of the sea but on their sides no wounding blade could fall nor any plume be marred in swiftest flight to starry skies they soared and left on earth their halfgnawed stolen feast and footprints foul celaeno only on a beetling crag took lofty perch and prophetess of ill shrieked malediction from her vulture breast because of slaughtered kine and ravished herd sons of laomedon have ye made war and will ye from their rightful kingdom drive the guiltless harpies hear o hear my word long in your bosoms may it rankle sore which jove omnipotent to phoebus gave phoebus to me a word of doom which i the furies elder sister here unfold to italy ye fare the willing winds your call have heard and ye shall have your prayer in some italian haven safely moored but never shall ye rear the circling walls of your own city till for this our blood by you unjustly spilt your famished jaws bite at your tables ayeand half devour 
		she spoke her pinions bore her to the grove and she was seen no more but all my band shuddered with shock of fear in each cold vein their drooping spirits trusted swords no more but turned to prayers and offerings asking grace scarce knowing if those creatures were divine or but vast birds illomened and unclean father anchises to the gods in heaven uplifted suppliant hands and on that shore due ritual made crying aloud ye gods avert this curse this evil turn away smile heaven upon your faithful votaries then bade he launch away the chain undo set every cable free and spread all sail oer the white waves we flew and took our way whereer the helmsman or the winds could guide now forestclad zacynthus met our gaze engirdled by the waves dulichium same and neritos a rocky steep uprose we passed the cliffs of ithaca that called laertes king and flung our curse on fierce ulysses hearth and native land nigh hoar leucates clouded crest we drew where phoebus temple feared by mariners loomed oer us thitherward we steered and reached the little port and town our weary fleet dropped anchor and lay beached along the strand

		meanwhile the trojans on the doleful shore bewailed misenus and brought tribute there of griefs last gift to his unheeding clay first of the fullsapped pine and wellhewn oak a lofty pyre they build then sombre boughs around it wreathe and in fair order range funereal cypress glittering arms are piled high over all on blazing coals they lift cauldrons of brass brimmed oer with waters pure and that cold lifeless clay lave and anoint with many a moan and cry on their last couch the poor dead limbs they lay and mantle oer with purple vesture and familiar pall then in sad ministry the chosen few with eyes averted as our sires did use hold the enkindling torch beneath the pyre  they gather up and burn the gifts of myrrh the sacred bread and bowls of flowing oil and when in flame the dying embers fall on thirsty ash they pour the streams of wine good corynaeus in an urn of brass the gathered relics hides and three times round with blessed olive branch and sprinkling dew purges the people with ablution cold in lustral rite oft chanting hail farewell faithful aeneas for his comrade built a mighty tomb and dedicated there trophy of arms with trumpet and with oar beneath a windy hill which now is called misenusfor all time the name to bear 
		after these toils they hasten to fulfil what else the sibyl said straightway they find a cave profound of entrance gaping wide oerhung with rock in gloom of sheltering grove near the dark waters of a lake whereby no bird might ever pass with scathless wing so dire an exhalation is breathed out from that dark deep of death to upper air  hence in the grecian tongue aornos called here first four youthful bulls of swarthy hide were led for sacrifice on each broad brow the priestess sprinkled wine twixt the two horns outplucked the lifted hair and cast it forth upon the holy flames beginning so her offerings then loudly sued the power of hecate a queen in heaven and hell some struck with knives and caught in shallow bowls the smoking blood aeneas lifted hand smote with a sword a sablefleeced ewe to night the mother of th eumenides and earth her sister dread next unto thee o proserpine a curst and barren cow then unto pluto stygian king he built an altar dark and piled upon the flames the ponderous entrails of the bulls and poured free oer the burning flesh the goodly oil then lo at dawns dim earliest beam began beneath their feet a groaning of the ground  the wooded hilltops shook and as it seemed shehounds of hell howled viewless through the shade  to hail their queen away 0 souls profane stand far away the priestess shrieked nor dare unto this grove come near aeneas on begin thy journey draw thy sheathed blade now all thy courage now th unshaken soul she spoke and burst into the yawning cave with frenzied step he follows where she leads and strides with feet unfaltering at her side
